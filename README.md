# Compiler Front-End Project

## Objective

This project involves designing and implementing the **front end of a compiler** for a simple example language. The compiler will process source code written in the specified language and produce an **Intermediate Representation (IR)**.

The project is divided into three main stages:

1. **Learning Lex and Yacc**
2. **Building a Lexical Analyzer and Parser**
3. **Implementing Semantic Analysis and Intermediate Code Generation**


###  Stage 1: Learning Lex and Yacc

- Complete the following tutorials:
  - [Using Lex](https://silcnitc.github.io/lex.html)
  - [Using Yacc](https://silcnitc.github.io/yacc.html)
  - [Using Lex with Yacc](https://silcnitc.github.io/ywl.html)

###  Stage 2: Lexical Analyzer and Parser

- Build a lexical analyzer using **Lex**
- Construct a parser using **Yacc**
- Parse programs written in the example language
- **Source language specification** will be provided later

###  Stage 3: Semantic Analysis and IR Generation

- Perform semantic analysis (type checking, symbol table handling, etc.)
- Generate Intermediate Representation (e.g., three-address code)
- Ensure correctness of the IR for valid programs
